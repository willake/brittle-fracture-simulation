# Brittle Fracture Simulation
This is the final project for INFOMGP course at Utrecht University in 2023. We implemented the fracture simulation based on the paper: [An Efficient Algorithm for Brittle Fracture Simulation](https://github.com/milesbarr/brittle-fracture-simulation/blob/main/paper.pdf).

Since we did not implemented voronoi diagram by ourselfs, we extended the project file from ![Base](https://github.com/Vekzzor/2D-Voronoi-Fracture/).
